- 👋 Hi, I’m @corypjohnson
- 👀 I’m interested in image analysis, data science and visualization, ML, deep learning, AI, and video game design -- though I am not currently capable of most of these, I am excited to be learning about them!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python and R for data manipulation and visualization
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that people are interested in having a somewhat novice MATLAB coder help with.
- 📫 How to reach me -- cory.p.johnson@maine.edu
